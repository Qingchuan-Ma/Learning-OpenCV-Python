# 细说 HighGUI

While OpenCV was designed for use in full-scale applications and can be used within functionally rich UI frameworks
(such as Qt\*, WinForms\*, or Cocoa\*) or without any UI at all, sometimes there it is required to try functionality quickly
and visualize the results. This is what the HighGUI module has been designed for.
